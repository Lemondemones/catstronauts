## :rocket: Result

By using Apollo Client with GraphQL, I learned to efficiently manage data and state in React applications. I explored GraphOS Studio's capabilities for building, testing, and documenting GraphQL queries. Additionally, I utilized Apollo Client's useQuery and useMutation hooks to execute queries and mutations, and applied GraphQL variables for dynamic data handling.
